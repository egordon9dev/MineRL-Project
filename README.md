# MineRL Project -- Deep Reinforcement Learning in Minecraft
We tested the DQN and PPO algorithms. The goal of the agent is to navigate the video-game environment. The agent must walk to a specified position given the camera data as input. The actions are simple movements: forward, backward, left, right, pan, etc.
